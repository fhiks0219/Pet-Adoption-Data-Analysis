# Pet-Adoption-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes pet adoption data to uncover trends in animal adoption.
The goal is to understand which animals are adopted most often, their average age,
and how long they typically stay in adoption centers.

This is a beginner-friendly data analysis project created using Python.

  - Average age per animal
  - Time spent in adoption centers
- Data visualization using bar charts

---

## Key Insights
- Some animals are adopted more frequently than others
- Average age varies by animal type
- Certain animals tend to stay longer in adoption centers
